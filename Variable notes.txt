t = current booking day
T = number of next arrival days to predict
tau = 0, 1, ..., T
H = total number of historical book days prior to today
h = 1, 2, ..., H
S = number of past book days prior to t-h

Output:
Given day t, we want to predict today's bookings plus the next T days worth of bookings, i.e. tau.
In terms of a word predictor, think of this as the word to be predicted at the end of a sentence.

Input:
We will input the previous H days worth of bookings, ie. h.
Think of this as the previous words in the sentence.

Note: Whenever you see (t-h) in the document, they usually mean one of the H previous days not the whole sequence.

For each day in h, we will look at the next T days of bookings, ie. tau.
This results in a 1D vector of size tau for X1, X2, and X3 for the day's month, day of the week, and average room rate.

Example X1 = Month for next tau booking days for current day  = [11, 11, 11, ..., 12, 12]
Example X2 = Day of Week for next tau booking days for current day = [6, 7, 1, 2, ..., #, #]

We need to also keep track of historical booking data over the past S days.
This results in an array of tau x S for ~Y~.

Example ~Y~ = Number of bookings for next tau booking days for the past S days =
1 1 0 0 2 4 0
. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
0 0 0 0 0 2 0 

Since the dataset we have does not include the room rate, we can only implement the Time-based LSTM model.
